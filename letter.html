	<h1>LETTER TO FUTURE SELF</h1>

	<p>Hey me, 
<br>
<br>
		You are in college about now, so how's college treating me? Does it make me cry? Laugh? 
		. . . I hope the Electrical Engineering course suits me. </p>

	<p>Did I make a lot of friends? . . . Well, since I am me, probably not. 
		I hope Iâ€™ve got some good hobbies, and no longer get bored of any and everything. </p>

	<p>Also, have I been making money from stock trading? 
		Or is the college workload not giving me the time to even think about it like school work did to me in High School?</p>

	<p>Anyway, have fun doing whatever I do.</p>

	<p>Past me, 
		Kingsley Quaye.

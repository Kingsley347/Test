				<p>The name’s Kingsley. I don’t really have favorites but I like cool technology. 
					I get bored easily so I try several things until I get bored of them. 
					Currently, I’m on music, anime, and manhuas/manhwas/mangas. 
					I lost interest in movies and games a while ago, and even some foods (mostly for stupid reasons). 
					I still play some mobile games, but only casual ones that don’t require much effort and skill like <em>ludo</em> and <em>Shoal of Fish</em>.</p>

<div id="ABOUT">
	<h1>ABOUT</h1>

		<p>My name is Kingsley Quaye. 
			I come from Ghana, located in West Africa. 
			I basically attended the school from Kindergarten to Junior High School, which is the equivalent of middle school up to the 9th grade. 
			The name of that school is Hope Christian Academy.
			Though I used to go to church, I consider myself a non religious person. </p>

		<p>The first High School I attended was Ghana National High College. 
			It is called ‘college’, but is actually a High School, and I don’t know why. 
			I was about to go to the 11th when I came to the United States. 
			However, I restarted High School in 9th grade.</p>

		<p>The High School I currently attend is High School for Service and Learning at Erasmus. 
			I’m now a 12th grader, about to graduate and move on to SUNY University at Buffalo where I will be pursuing an Electrical Engineering degree.</p>

	<h1>LETTER TO FUTURE SELF</h1>

	<p>Hey me, 
<br>
<br>
		You are in college about now, so how's college treating me? Does it make me cry? Laugh? 
		. . . I hope the Electrical Engineering course suits me. </p>

	<p>Did I make a lot of friends? . . . Well, since I am me, probably not. 
		I hope I’ve got some good hobbies, and no longer get bored of any and everything. </p>

	<p>Also, have I been making money from stock trading? 
		Or is the college workload not giving me the time to even think about it like school work did to me in High School?</p>

	<p>Anyway, have fun doing whatever I do.</p>

	<p>Past me, 
		Kingsley Quaye.

	<h1>ABOUT</h1>

		<p>My name is Kingsley Quaye. 
			I come from Ghana, located in West Africa. 
			I basically attended the school from Kindergarten to Junior High School, which is the equivalent of middle school up to the 9th grade. 
			The name of that school is Hope Christian Academy.
			Though I used to go to church, I consider myself a non religious person. </p>

		<p>The first High School I attended was Ghana National High College. 
			It is called ‘college’, but is actually a High School, and I don’t know why. 
			I was about to go to the 11th when I came to the United States. 
			However, I restarted High School in 9th grade.</p>

		<p>The High School I currently attend is High School for Service and Learning at Erasmus. 
			I’m now a 12th grader, about to graduate and move on to SUNY University at Buffalo where I will be pursuing an Electrical Engineering degree.
